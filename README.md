# Roll Your Own API
[Content API's getTagInfo method](https://developer.blackbaud.com/lo-api/loapi/content/getTagInfo) is great, but it didn't always exist (and still returns one answer for one request). This technique lets you combine S-tags, conditionals, RPN, etc. and make a custom RESTful endpoint that returns the exact data in the exact format you need.


## In this collection
- **Group Scroller**: Convert the output of S450 to a JSON/JSONP object for use off-site or in your own scripts.
